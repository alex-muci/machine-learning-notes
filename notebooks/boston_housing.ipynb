    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",
    "- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",

    "**Answer: ** I expect the value of 'MEDV' to have a positive relationship with each of the three features:\n",
    "- 'RM' (number of rooms): a larger number of rooms tends to relate to bigger houses, and hence higher prices 'MEDV' (whilst the marginal square metre cost may decline, the total cost of bigger and bigger houses can only increase).\n",
    "- 'LSTAT' (percent of lower class workers): the lower the percentate of lower class workers in a neighborhood, the higher will be the prices of houses. Here the casual relationship may be the other way round: expensive neighborhoods tend to price out lower class workers overtime but still such feature is useful to estimate house prices in that area.\n",
    "- 'PTRATIO' (ratio of students to teachers): the lower such ratio, the higher the house prices 'MEDV'. If it is like in Europe, and I guess it is, smaller classes tend to be associated with better student performance - some of these schools may simply be private (expensive) schools (more teachers/smaller classes). Wealthier buyers (parents) would pay a premium to buy into neighborhoods with schoools that have smaller classes to benefit their offspring."

Such a minimum is the the point at which extra complexity increases more the variance (test error) than reduces bias (training error), i.e. going from under-fitting to over-fitting. In short, by splitting dataset in training/test we can analyse the trade-off between training error (bias) reduction and testing error (variance) increase."

    "\n",
    "I choose the model with 'max_depth' parameter = 3 (upper-right graph). \n",
    "\n",
    "As we add more data (or training points) the charts show the evolution of the testing and training scores: this helps us to assess the trade-off between variance error (testing score) and bias error (training score), i.e. under or over-fitting, vs. data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the first chart ('max_depth'=1) both testing and training scores do not improve with more data as they both converge to a low score; that means that we need a richer model (training score is poor, i.e. the model [max_depth=1] is underfit). The last chart ('max_depth'=10) has a quite complex model that performs well in training, but fail to converge - even with more data - to a meaningful score; this model is clearly overfit: too complex and does not generalise when we add more data. \n",
    "The model with 'max_depth' = 3 seems about right, hence my choice (convergece to relatively high score for both training and testing sets).\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though it is generally true that the more data the better, convergence tends to slow down significantly after a certain number of points. For example, our chosen model does not seem to improve after 300 points. \n",

The graph produces two complexity curves — one for training and one for validation.

    "\n",
    "When thinking about how k-fold cross validation helps grid search, think about the main drawbacks of grid search which are hinged upon **using a particular subset of data for training or testing** and how k-fold cv could help alleviate that. You can refer to the [docs](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html#cross-validation) for your answer."

    "k-fold cross-validation: the dataset is randomly divided into k (equal-sized) subsets. Of these subsets, one is left out for testing the model, the rest (k − 1 subsets) are used to learn the data (training and cross-validation). The trainining/cross-validation is repeated k times (folds) - each subset is used only once for validation - and the results from the folds are averaged to produce a single set of estimates. Only then we use the resulting model on the testing set.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, assuming 2 folds cross-validation: we randomly partition the training dataset into three sets of equal size - say s1, s2, s3. We leave out one set (e.g. s3) for final testing, and then we train & cross-validate the other two (e.g. train on s1 and cross-validate on s2 and, vice-versa: train on s2 and cross-validate on s1), the best paramaters are then the average of these two cross-validation processes (2-folds). The resulting model is then validated/tested on s3 (the test set).\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefit of k-fold cross-validaton: minimising the risk of overfitting by using the test set (knowledge-leakage). The dataset is split into an extra part - called “validation set” - besides the usual training and test sets (training is still perfomed on the training set, but evaluted on the validation set). However, in order to avoid wasting data/reducing samples too much (i.e. results dependending on particular random split of too smaller sets), 1. we use k-1 sets for the training and the remaning one for validation, 2. repeat k-times this to get best/chosen model as an average, then 3. validate the resulting model on the left-out test set. \n",

    "### Implementation: Fitting a Model\n",
    "Your final implementation requires that you bring everything together and train a model using the **decision tree algorithm**. To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you will find your implementation is using `ShuffleSplit()` for an alternative form of cross-validation (see the `'cv_sets'` variable). While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. While you're working on your implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that ShuffleSplit has different parameters in scikit-learn versions 0.17 and 0.18.\n",

Besides, what was an affluent neighborhood in 1978 may be a different area after almost 40 years, and vice-versa (e.g. due to different types of immigration, change in industries and employments, ...). Inflation here i the least of concerns - some area may have outstripped inflation by far, whilst others may have even lagged behind - after 40y small differences translate in large absolute differences."
